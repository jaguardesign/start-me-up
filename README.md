# Start Me Up

![](http://i.imgur.com/ubdJQL7.jpg)

Because bootstrapping a new development machine can make a grown man (or woman) cry.

More than a little bit inspired by Thoughtbot's [Laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/) scripts, but opinionated for our use.

## Notes

This script works with Mac OS X 10.9+

## Instructions

Run the following command from the command line:

    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaguardesign/start-me-up/master/start.sh)

## What It Installs

See the [Brewfile](https://github.com/jaguardesignstudio/start-me-up/blob/master/Brewfile) for the list of applications installed.
